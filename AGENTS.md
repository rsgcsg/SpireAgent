# STS2 MCP — AI Gameplay Guide

## Project Steering For Agents

Before changing this project, read:

- `docs/PROJECT_STEERING.md`
- `docs/ITERATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `docs/ai-agent-architecture.md`
- `DEBUG_REPORT.md`

This repository is intended to be pushed to GitHub and redeployed by other users. Keep docs, commands, and tests in sync with behavior.

The architecture is LLM-first + layered local scaffold + structured memory + derived strategy + lightweight learning. Do not turn it into a rigid pure rules bot, and do not make LLM face raw state dumps.

## Live Testing Policy

When testing in a real game, normal HP loss is not a stop condition. Do not pause a live run just because the agent took damage, made a debatable card pick, or chose an imperfect route.

Stop and patch mid-run only for clear program/design bugs:

- invalid MCP/REST action
- no candidates on an actionable screen
- unknown screen that blocks progress
- repeated same action without progress
- stale card index or illegal target
- settlement/polling loop
- crash/type error
- invalid LLM output escaping validation

Strategy quality issues should usually be logged, collected, reviewed, and fixed after the run or at a natural room/node boundary.

## MCP Tool Calling Tips

### State Polling
- After `combat_end_turn`, the state may show `is_play_phase: false` or `turn: enemy`. Call `get_game_state` again to advance to the next player turn.
- Sometimes you need to call `get_game_state` twice — once to see enemy turn results, once to see your new hand.
- Use `format: "json"` during combat for structured data; `format: "markdown"` for map/event overview.

### Card Index Shifting
- **CRITICAL**: Playing a card removes it from hand and shifts all indices. Play cards from RIGHT to LEFT (highest index first) to keep lower indices stable, or re-check state between plays.
- When targeting, always provide `target` for single-target cards. Entity IDs are UPPER_SNAKE_CASE with a `_0` suffix (e.g. `KIN_PRIEST_0`).

### Event & Reward Flow
- Events: `event_choose_option`. After choosing, there's often a "Proceed" option at index 0.
- Rest sites: `rest_choose_option`, then `proceed_to_map`.
- Rewards: claim from right-to-left (highest index first) to avoid index shifting. Card rewards open a sub-screen; use `rewards_pick_card` or `rewards_skip_card`.

### Potions
- `use_potion(slot=N)` — slot is the potion slot index, not a card index.
- `discard_potion(slot=N)` — discard a potion to free up the slot when full.
- Potions don't cost energy or count as card plays. Use buff potions BEFORE playing cards.

## General Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **HP is a resource, not a score.** Take calculated damage to deal more. Don't waste energy on block when enemies aren't attacking.
2. **Deck quality > deck size.** Skip card rewards if nothing synergizes. A lean deck draws key cards more often.
3. **Front-load damage.** Killing enemies faster means less total damage taken.
4. **Read intents carefully.** Sleep/Buff = go all-out offense. Attack = balance block and damage. Debuff = usually no damage, offense turn.

### Combat Sequencing (General)
1. Play 0-cost utility/setup cards first.
2. Play skills before attacks when possible — many mechanics reward this order (e.g. Slow debuff on enemies stacks per card played).
3. Play biggest attacks last to benefit from accumulated buffs/debuffs.
4. Check enemy HP — if you can kill this turn, skip blocking entirely.

### Map Pathing
- **Elites** give relics — fight them when healthy (>70% HP).
- **Rest before Boss** — heal if below 80% HP. Boss fights are long and punishing.
- **Unknown nodes** are safer than Elites. Good at medium HP.
- **Shops** — visit with 100+ gold.
- **Deck quality matters more than quantity** — don't add cards just because they're offered.

### Boss Fights
- **Kill the leader, not the minions.** Enemies with "Minion" power flee when their leader dies.
- Use potions aggressively in boss fights — they don't carry between acts.
- Boss fights are wars of attrition. The longer they go, the more enemies scale with Strength buffs.

### Potion Usage
- Don't hoard potions. Dying with full potions is the worst outcome.
- Use permanent-value potions (Fruit Juice = +5 Max HP) early in any combat.
- Use buff potions (Flex Potion) on turns with multiple attacks.

### Common Mistakes
- Blocking when enemies are sleeping/buffing — waste of energy.
- Not checking card indices after playing — indices shift left.
- Taking too long to kill bosses — enemies scale every turn.
- Adding mediocre cards that dilute the deck before boss fights.
