## Snapshot

Capabilities carry Host/game/Modset identity, environment fingerprint and
optional Host implementation provenance. The hot Snapshot carries:

```text
snapshot_id, sequence, status, persistent,
interaction { interaction_id, kind, stage, prompt, content_schema, content, capabilities[] },
referents[], reads[], completeness,
bound_actions { status, counts, limit, ordering_semantics, actions[] },
session { runtime_instance_id, environment_fingerprint }, information_policy
```

A referent is a player-visible object or control identity. Facts create
referents independently of action publication. Exact screen, room, hand, slot
and annotation-input bindings never enter Surface facts. Optional `enabled`,
`selected` and `focused` are observed state, not global legality; current C1
does not yet claim keyboard/controller focus coverage. Interaction capabilities
describe current verbs and participant roles without enumerating operand
tuples. A finite bound action has one optional `subject_ref` plus role-labelled
`arguments[]`; each reference must exist in the current snapshot. Exact native
operands stay inside the Host.

`bound_actions.status=complete` proves every current finite binding was
materialized. `truncated` preserves the Snapshot but grants no Re execution
authority or interaction capability. Every public operand must already name a
current visible Referent. Counts, limit and deterministic ordering make loss
auditable. `status=interactive` is valid exactly when the complete projection
is non-empty.

`reads[]` advertises all bounded, non-authorizing information reads. Consumers
send the opaque `read_id`; C rejects stale snapshots and arbitrary fields.
Interactive consumers may read lazily. Memoryless consumers may prefetch and
aggregate selected advertised reads, but every result must retain the same
snapshot, runtime and environment identity; that aggregation is a downstream
projection, not a different C ontology.

## Action And Receipt

An action request contains request ID, expected snapshot ID, opaque bound-action
ID and controller lease identity. C rebuilds the interaction, referents and
exact native binding immediately before delivery.

Receipts are `delivered`, `not_delivered` or `unknown`. Delivered proves native input
delivery, not business completion. Unknown delivery never permits automatic
retry. The receipt repeats the public subject/arguments and may include an
immediate successor.

## Host Neutrality

Live and future Headless Hosts implement the same fair-player semantics. A
Headless Host need not fabricate UI nodes or .NET MVIDs; it must provide stable
interaction/referent identity, equivalent capabilities and bound actions, exact environment identity
and equivalent stale/idempotency behavior. Reset, seed, save/load, clone/fork,
fast-step, scenario mutation, rewards and tensors are separate APIs.

## Exclusions

C contains no source authority, SourceContract, business Outcome, hidden state,
arbitrary reflection, coordinate input, model-generated native operand,
strategy, reward or privileged simulator control.

## Native-Page Evidence

`native_pages.v1` is a default-off operator evidence profile, not a consumer
action API. Sessions are snapshot/runtime bound, reserve the current input owner,
suppress mutation, verify open/read/return and expose explicit recovery. They do
not create mutation authority or enter the action ledger.
