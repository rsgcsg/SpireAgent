# Replay And Eval

Replay and eval are the observability loop for learning safely.

## Current State

Implemented:

- `npm run collect:state`
- `npm run collect:watch`
- `npm run agent:review`
- decision log with route, LLM audit, fallback, checkpoint
- `AgentDecisionRecorder` for executed agent actions
- `data/runs/<runId>/metadata.json`
- `data/runs/<runId>/snapshots/`
- `data/runs/<runId>/events.jsonl`
- `data/runs/<runId>/transitions.jsonl`
- minimal `data/runs/<runId>/replay.json` placeholder
- replay reader timeline helpers
- `npm run data:replay -- <runId-or-run-dir>`
- `npm run data:eval -- --latest`
- `npm run data:eval -- --run-id <runId>`
- `npm run data:eval -- --run-dir <path>`
- grouped eval warning summary
- lightweight strategy quality metrics

Missing:

- human recorder with diff fallback
- labeled-example export

## Replay Goal

Replay does not need to drive the real game at first. It should read run data and answer:

- What screen was this?
- What did the agent or human see?
- What legal actions were available?
- Which action was selected?
- Was it local, LLM, fallback, human, or inferred?
- What changed after the action?
- What did memory and derived knowledge say at that time?

## Eval Goal

Offline eval runs deterministic engineering checks over saved transitions. It normalizes pre-state snapshots, regenerates candidates, and emits lightweight strategy-quality metrics. Strategy metrics are WARN-only signals, not FAIL criteria and not policy tuning.

The eval runner is retrospective by design. If candidate legality is fixed after a live run, old transitions can become `FAIL` because the selected historical action no longer matches regenerated legal candidates. Treat that as useful bug evidence, then validate current code on a fresh run.

As of Phase 2.6, a fresh run returning `WARN` with zero errors is acceptable for engineering health when the focused warnings are strategy-quality metrics or documented audit categories. Normal flow and acceptable settlement warnings are summarized in `warningSummary` instead of flooding the top-level `warnings` list.

Useful checks:

- candidate generation is non-empty on actionable screens
- selected action is legal
- selected action matches a regenerated candidate
- hand index shift is safe
- human inference ambiguity is marked uncertain
- transition JSONL is parseable
- run IDs and transition IDs are consistent
- snapshot references exist
- ground-truth invariants hold
- hard/unknown checkpoints and settlement timeouts are surfaced
- stale index, illegal target, repeated no-progress, and unknown-screen blocking risks are surfaced

Warning categories:

- `normal_flow_checkpoint`: expected hard checkpoints such as menu/reward/map/rest/proceed/end-turn/card-reward transitions and combat actions that visibly remove a card, kill an enemy, or change screen.
- `acceptable_settlement_timeout`: low-visibility transitions such as shop purchases, treasure claims, menu character selection, card-select toggles, or visible combat progress where REST state does not expose a clean settled marker.
- `program_risk`: truly dangerous repeated no-progress or empty logs.
- `historical_fixed_evidence`: old run evidence from bugs that have since been fixed and covered.
- `strategy_quality`: low HP/high incoming/block deficit/deck thickness/potion/fallback/tempo metrics.
- `needs_fixture_bug_candidate`: actionable suspicious transitions that are not yet explained and should become fixtures if they repeat.

Action identity note:

- replay/eval timeline labels include card/action indices for indexed actions, such as `play_card:2:Strike->ENEMY_0` and `select_card:1:Strike`.
- This keeps repeated no-progress detection from collapsing distinct card-select choices that share the same card name.

Latest Phase 2.5 signal:

- `run-mr0rfdcb-yewhg8` currently evaluates as `WARN` with zero errors after 574 parsed transitions.
- A fresh 200 tick run after the latest fixes completed from Act 2 floor 20 rewards to Act 2 floor 31 combat.
- Warnings in that run include historical repeated no-progress evidence from before the card-select guard fix, plus hard/unknown checkpoint and settlement audit items. These are follow-up audit inputs, not current eval errors.

Latest Phase 2.6 signal:

- `run-mr192jap-y1qb0x` evaluates as `WARN` with zero errors after 142 parsed transitions.
- Replay/eval matched 142 selected actions against regenerated candidates.
- `needs_fixture_bug_candidate` is zero after normal menu/card-select/kill-flow hard checkpoints were reclassified.
- Focused warnings are strategy-only: block deficit, one low-pressure potion use, and fallback-heavy decisions.
- This run reached Act 1 floor 15 rewards with HP 39/75 after a fresh 200 tick verification.

## Commands

```bash
npm run data:replay
npm run data:replay -- --latest
npm run data:eval
npm run data:eval -- --latest
```

Example:

```bash
npm run data:replay -- run-mr0ckah9-99khw3
npm run data:eval -- --run-id run-mr0ckah9-99khw3
```

Eval status:

- `PASS`: no engineering errors or warnings.
- `WARN`: no hard engineering failure, but strategy metrics, checkpoint summaries, settlement summaries, or actionable audit candidates should be reviewed.
- `FAIL`: malformed run data, invariant violation, invalid/missing snapshot refs, illegal selected action, or other program-level risk.

Future scripts:

```bash
npm run data:record:human
npm run data:export
```

Keep existing scripts compatible.
